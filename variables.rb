#EXERCISES FROM CHAPTER: VARIABLES

#1. Write a program called name.rb that asks the user to type in their name and then prints out a greeting message with their name included.
  #see name.rb

#2. Write a program called age.rb that asks a user how old they are and then tells them how old they will be in 10, 20, 30 and 40 years. Below is the output for someone 20 years old.
  # see age.rb

#3. Add another section onto name.rb that prints the name of the user 10 times. You must do this without explicitly writing the puts method 10 times in a row. Hint: you can use the times method to do something repeatedly.
  # see name.rb

#4. Modify name.rb again so that it first asks the user for their first name, saves it into a variable, and then does the same for the last name. Then outputs their full name all at once.

#5. What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?
  # The first program will print 3 to the screen, the second will give an error because x is a local variable located inside the scope of the do block and cannot be accessed from outisde of that chunk of code.

#6. What does the following error message tell you?
  # The variable "shoes" is not accessible from wherever it is trying to be called from, or may not have been defined yet.
